# J2EE-Framework - The objective of this project is to acquire a comprehensive understanding and practical experience of the DAO-DTO design pattern in the Java programming language. The project aims to implement the design pattern to separate the data access layer from the rest of the application, allowing for improved maintainability and testability of the code. The DAO is responsible for interacting with the database and retrieving data, while the DTO serves as a transfer object to transfer data between the DAO and the rest of the application in a decoupled manner.
The DAO-DTO design pattern is a pattern used in Java to separate the data access layer (DAO) from the rest of the application. The DAO is responsible for interacting with the database and retrieving data, while the DTO (data transfer object) is used to transfer data between the DAO and the rest of the application. The DTO is a simple Java object that contains getters and setters for the data it holds, and is used to transfer data between the DAO and the rest of the application in a way that is decoupled from the database. This separation of concerns allows for better maintainability and testability of the code.
